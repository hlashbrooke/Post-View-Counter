A counter to track how many times your posts are viewed.

== Description ==

"Post View Counter" does what it says on the tin - it counts how many hits your posts receive.

This is not meant as a replacement for more advanced analytics plugins - it is a counter so you can see which of your posts are more popular without diving too deeply into complicated viewing statistics.

= What is the shortcode for displaying the post hit count? =

The shortcode to display an individual post's hit count is: `[post_views]`. If you use the shortcode without any parameters then it will displaying the hit count for the current post. Alternatively you can specify which post's hit count you would like to display by using the shortcode like this: `[post_views post=123]` where `123` is the ID of the post.
